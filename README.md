# @reflame/cli

This is a workaround for deploying from GH actions with a stripped-down version of the Reflame GitHub app that doesn't require direct code access.

It's usually much slower (10s+ instead of < 3s) than deploying with the standard Reflame GitHub app with direct code access. Not recommended unless direct code access is a deal-breaker for your team.
